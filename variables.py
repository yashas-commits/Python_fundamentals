'''
A variable is a name (label) that refers to a
value.

 Assignment Operator (=): Assigns the right
side to the left.

Variables are pointers to memory locations.

“When you assign a value to a variable, Python decides the data type automatically.”

“You dont declare types in Python — the value decides the type.”

“This makes Python flexible, but it also means you must be careful.”
'''
message = 'Hello Python!'
age = 25
AGE = 'TEN'

'''
Must start with a letter or underscore (_).

* Cannot start with a number.

* Case-sensitive (Age != age).

* Pythonic Way: use snake_case for
readability.

* Avoid reserved keywords (if, while, print).

'''
23_Name = 'SHIVA'  #error

'''
Python determines type at runtime.

* You can reassign a variable to a different
type without errors.

data = 10 # Initially an int
data = 'Ten' # Now a string!

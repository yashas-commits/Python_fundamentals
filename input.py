Understanding input()

“Until now, our programs used fixed values.”
“Real programs need input from users.”
“In Python, input is handled using the input() function.”
“Important rule: input() always returns a string.”



'''

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)

city = input("Enter your city: ")
print("Nice to meet you,", name)
print("You are from", city)

age = input("Enter your age: ")
print(age + 5)

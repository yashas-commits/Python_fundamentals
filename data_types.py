“Python has many data types, but today we focus on four core ones.”
“Integers represent whole numbers — counts, quantities, ages.”
“Floats represent decimal values — heights, weights, measurements.”
“Strings represent text — names, messages, labels.”
“Booleans represent logic — True or False.”
“Python behaves differently depending on the data type, so understanding this is critical.”

age = 21
height = 5.8
name = "Shreyas"

#Inspect types:
print(type(age))
print(type(height))
print(type(name))
print(type(is_student))


#print("Age is " + age)

“Python is telling us that it cannot add text and a number.”
“Python does not guess or convert automatically — it protects your data.”
“This behavior prevents silent bugs, especially in data science.”


"so type casting is required"
